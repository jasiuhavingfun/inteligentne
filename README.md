# ðŸŒ± Intelligent Plant Disease Classifier

**Short Description:**
A Python-based application that classifies plant diseases using **machine learning models**, developed as an educational project.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning** for **plant disease detection**.
It was created as part of a course project to explore data-driven approaches for agricultural applications.

The system takes images of plant leaves as input and predicts potential diseases based on trained models.
